COMPUTER,COMPUTER WONT BOOT,"If your computer doesn't turn on, there could be several reasons for this issue. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

Check the power source: Ensure that your computer is properly connected to a working power outlet. Try plugging in another device to the same outlet to verify if the outlet is functioning correctly.

Power cable and adapter: Make sure the power cable is securely connected to your computer and the power adapter. If possible, try using a different power cable or adapter to eliminate the possibility of a faulty connection.

Battery (if applicable): If you are using a laptop, check if the battery is charged. Connect your laptop to a power source and try turning it on without the battery. If it turns on, the battery may need to be replaced.

Reset the power supply: If your computer has a built-in power supply unit (PSU), you can try resetting it. Turn off the main power switch on the back of the computer (if available), unplug the power cord, and then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds. Reconnect the power cord and try turning on the computer again.

Hardware issues: If none of the above steps work, there may be a hardware problem with your computer. It could be a faulty power supply, motherboard, or other components. In such cases, it's recommended to seek professional help or contact the manufacturer for further assistance.
